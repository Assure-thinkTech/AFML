# Advances in Financial Machine Learning

All the experimental answers for exercises from Advances in Financial Machine Learning by Dr Marco Lopez de Prado.

This book can teach you necessary quant skills, the exercises provided in the book is a great way to ensure you will have a solid understanding of implementating quantitative strategy. From "A" to "Z".

The book itself teaches very rational methods to quantitative finance, most of the concepts (especially triple barriers) can be cross-reference to other strategies types (not just mean-reversion) such as volatilities, trends.

If you decide to write the code from scratch (Highly recommend!) and use my notebook answers as a reference, you will need the below:

* Python 3.7.4
* numpy 1.17.3
* numba 0.49.1
* pandas 1.0.3
* matplotlib 3.1.1
* sklearn 0.23.1
* statsmodels 0.10.1

**Other References**

There is another library that was created way before mine (Actually more than 1 before mine), I will strongly recommend you to download their library, as a reference as you try to implement the codes. As well as their exercises, to see if our answers are somewhat similar to yours.

* [mlfinlab library](https://github.com/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab)
* [mlfinlab Exercises](https://github.com/hudson-and-thames/research/tree/master/Advances%20in%20Financial%20Machine%20Learning)

If you are interested in quantitative research, but do not have high-frequency data. I created a code snippet for you to generate some HFT data to get you started.

**Disclaimer**

All the codes used in this exercise was created from scratch by myself based on what was taught in the book (Which took quite an effort).

As much as possible, I used multiprocessing (parallelisation) and pandas only. (As a challenge)

Therefore the answers might be different from mlfinlab.

However, our sample data (Based on dollar bar) are identical.
