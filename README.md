# Advances in Financial Machine Learning

All the experimental answers for exercises from Advances in Financial Machine Learning by [Dr Marcos LÃ³pez de Prado](https://twitter.com/lopezdeprado?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor).

This book can teach you necessary quant skills, the exercises provided in the book is a great way to ensure you will have a solid understanding of implementating quantitative strategy. From "A" to "Z".

The book itself teaches very rational methods to quantitative finance, most of the concepts (especially triple barriers/ bet sizing) can be cross-reference to other strategies types (not just mean-reversion) such as volatilities, trends.

If you decide to write the code from scratch (Highly recommend!) and use my notebook answers as a reference, you will need the below:

* Python 3.7.4
* numpy 1.17.3
* numba 0.49.1
* pandas 1.0.3
* matplotlib 3.1.1
* sklearn 0.23.1
* statsmodels 0.10.1

**Other References**

There is another library that was created way before mine (Actually more than 1 before mine), I will strongly recommend you to download their library, as a reference as you try to implement the codes. 

As well as their exercises, to see if our answers are somewhat similar to yours.

* [mlfinlab library](https://github.com/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab)
* [mlfinlab Exercises](https://github.com/hudson-and-thames/research/tree/master/Advances%20in%20Financial%20Machine%20Learning)

Pls donate to them if you are leveraging mlfinlab expertise, it's not easy to maintain open-source library.

If you are interested in quantitative research, but do not have high-frequency data. I created a code snippet for you to generate some synthetic HFT data to get you started.

**Disclaimer**

I'm not using mlfinlab to complete these exercise, but I do compare my answers with theirs.

At the same time, this repository can only cover concepts and demostrate implementation. If you intend to deploy real quantitative strategies, you will require real HFT data.

You will need to purchase "Advances in Financial Machine Learning" in order to follow the tutorial. 

This is a textbook that is used in [Cornell University graduate studies](https://www.orie.cornell.edu/news/orie-adds-marcos-lopez-de-prado-cornell-financial-engineering-manhattan), that is why we are using it as a guide.
