This book can teach you necessary quant skills, the exercises provided in the book is a great way to ensure you will have a solid understanding of implementating quantitative strategy. From "A" to "Z".

The book itself teaches very rational methods to quantitative finance, most of the concepts (especially triple barriers/ bet sizing) can be cross-reference to other strategies types (not just mean-reversion) such as volatilities, trends.

If you decide to write the code from scratch (Highly recommend!) and use my notebook answers as a reference, you will need the below:

* Python 3.7.4
* numpy 1.17.3
* scipy 1.3.1
* numba 0.49.1
* pandas 1.0.3
* matplotlib 3.1.1
* sklearn 0.23.1
* statsmodels 0.10.1

**Disclaimer**

Apart from the above modules, all the codes ran in these notebook were written from scratch (Private Repository).

If you are interested in quantitative research, but do not have high-frequency data. I created a code snippet for you to generate some synthetic HFT data to get you started.
